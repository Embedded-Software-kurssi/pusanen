a. Debugger is a tool with can be used to run program and testi it step by step and check the variables.
b. We need debugger to find problems in our programs.
c. We can specify the fault area from the program.
d. There isnt allways serial and it is kind of slow to type it all.
e. Breakpoint is a point that you can put  any line in program. Or multiple breapoints.
f. The main difference is that with when we are testing programs we try prove that there is no erros and when we are
debugging program then we are trying to find whats wrong in the program.
g. It is realworld debugger for debugging software do run hardware.
h. jtag is 4-wire test acces port to testing circuit boards, aWire uses the reset wire from the board and allows to programming
and debugging it propeply,  swd  is a subset of the jtag interface.
i. We can see the faults in memory level from the program.


5.
a. It is translating writed code to machinecode.
b. Linker is linkig created files together.
c. Preprocessor is a # that can compiled before a prime program and it isnt taking memory.
d. Symbolic machine language
e. Fields that are declared volatile are not subject to compiler optimizations. Some times it wont work propebly
if the code is optimized.
f. It becomes to be a machine language. BOOM!
g. Compile is translating code to machine language and the compile is included to build.
